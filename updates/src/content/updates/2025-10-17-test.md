title: Before we start building!
description: We conducted interviews with firefighters. Early detection fails in
  the same places where terrain blocks cameras, connectivity drops, and public
  reports arrive with missing details. Our system must close these gaps with
  local sensing, time based models, and fast confirmation paths that work even
  when the usual tools fail.

> "It's you know, getting our units on the way and to the correct location as soon as possible. Is paramount. That is what is preached up, you know, upon us, and we understand that that call comes in for a wildfire, with it being dry and a lot of undergrowth here, We know how quickly these can spread." - Firefighter from Texas.

We kicked off this research with the help of our friend Sergi Perdices, founder of [WhyserAI](https://www.whyser.ai/), who connected us with firefighters working directly on the line. Their input matters because the scale of the problem is easy to underestimate. Take California for example. The state spans more than one hundred sixty thousand square miles, much of it covered by canyons, ridges, and deep folds where a camera on a tower cannot see below the slope. A single lookout camera might cover forty or fifty miles in one direction but still miss smoke that rises on the far side of a ridge. The same holds true in places like Australia and southern Europe where terrain, distance, and heat create long blind zones. When a fire starts in one of these pockets, the first true signal often comes from a passerby with a weak description, and minutes slip away before crews have a confirmed location.

This is why we began interviewing firefighters. We wanted the ground truth rather than the desk version. They pointed out exactly where the first ten minutes are lost, why camera networks miss events, where satellite alerts fail, and how terrain slows both detection and access. Their stories outline the actual conditions that shape early response, and this guides our work more than any static map or theoretical model.

**Learnings so far**

The interviews highlight a simple pattern. Detection systems fail in the same places where terrain and connectivity are weakest. Any system we build must treat blind spots, low data situations, and slow human reporting as primary design constraints rather than afterthoughts. This means models that run at the edge, sensors that stay reliable without strong network support, and confirmation signals that do not depend on perfect imagery. Our focus should remain on closing the gap between the moment a fire starts and the moment a crew receives trustworthy information.

**Methodology**

We interviewed 7 wildland firefighters and a Deputy Fire Chief across California, Oregon, Florida, and Texas.

| Camera limits                  | Zooming reduces clarity and creates guesswork          | *“You keep zooming and zooming until you ask yourself, is that a smudge or is that a fire.” "Most people can't describe fires or wind conditions"* |

| Terrain and access issues      | Physical obstacles stack up time                       | *“A railcar can block the only crossing. Sometimes we cut gates or clear brush to reach the area.”*                                                |

| Public education               | People need guidance on reporting and defensible space | *“If you could train people to get GPS coordinates better, that would be helpful.”*                                                                |

The interviews give us early signaling to hack on a system must handle weak initial information, camera blind zones created by terrain, low quality zoomed views, and the reality of false satellite alerts. 

It needs to run locally because crews often lose connectivity, and it must treat detection as a time based signal rather than a single image so it can distinguish smoke and flame from fog or dust. Since access delays are common, the system should surface route issues early, and it should include a fast confirmation path through drones because firefighters repeatedly said this saves minutes. Finally, the system must support simple location reporting for the public, since unclear coordinates remain the biggest source of delay in the first ten minutes.

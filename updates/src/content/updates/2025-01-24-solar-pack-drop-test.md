## Drill recap

- Ran a rapid redeploy scenario: pulled a sentinel tower, swapped batteries, and re-established telemetry in **11 minutes**.
- Drop-tested the ruggedized solar pack from 2.5 m—no cracked cells, but the latch needs more damping on impact.
- Practiced “pack and go” scripting with the new staging checklist; shaved 40% off load-out time for the second team.

## Findings

- Tower anchor bolts seize when pulled hot; adding copper anti-seize to every kit going forward.
- The mesh self-heals fast, but visual confirmation of the new topology lagged behind—UI needs a “rebuild now” button.
- Solar telemetry shows the new MPPT firmware holding steady even in partial shade.

## Follow-ups

- Order improved latch dampers and test again next week.
- Add redeploy drills to onboarding for every new field hire.
- Work with product to expose immediate mesh status refresh controls.

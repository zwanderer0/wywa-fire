So image 1 is testing the monitoring setup with 41 nodes, temperature and humidity and with coordinate data and signal strength at the at the at the Sentinel hub where the signals are coming in. And also like wind speed and those parameters, the image one file one. 


The file 3 MP4 video is about testing out the interpretation and how it transmits to the radio in a completely internet situation. All of the data is being processed locally, translated and being TTS'd out with a local model. That then uses software defined radio, SDR, to transmit on a frequency that can be listened in on a radio in the range of 10 miles line of sight. 



File 4 is a very early stage prototype on a dev board where we are trying to see if BME 690 is basically are we able to use the small models on the Bosch sensor, the resistance based sensor. Yeah, and curve and detect between incense and brush fires. 


File 5 is basically the test system with edge compute and radio and camera which connects to remote nodes. The sentinel basically. 

File 6 is the image of the sentinel taking in all the sensor data from multiple sensors and understanding the interpretation and transmitting it via HACRF-SDR.

# Fusion Starter

A production-ready full-stack React application template with integrated Express server, featuring React Router 6 SPA mode, TypeScript, Vitest, Zod and modern tooling.

While the starter comes with a express server, only create endpoint when strictly neccesary, for example to encapsulate logic that must leave in the server, such as private keys handling, or certain DB operations, db...

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + React Router 6 (spa) + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS 3
- **Backend**: Express server integrated with Vite dev server
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **UI**: Radix UI + TailwindCSS 3 + Lucide React icons

## Key Features

## SPA Routing System

The routing system is powered by React Router 6:

- `client/pages/Index.tsx` represents the home page.
- Routes are defined in `client/App.tsx` using the `react-router-dom` import
- Route files are located in the `client/pages/` directory

For example, routes can be defined with:

```typescript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Index />} />
  {/* ADD ALL CUSTOM ROUTES ABOVE THE CATCH-ALL "*" ROUTE */}
  <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
</Routes>;
```

### Styling System

- **Primary**: TailwindCSS 3 utility classes
- **Theme and design tokens**: Configure in `client/global.css` 
- **UI components**: Pre-built library in `client/components/ui/`
- **Utility**: `cn()` function combines `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` for conditional classes

```typescript
// cn utility usage
className={cn(
  "base-classes",
  { "conditional-class": condition },
  props.className  // User overrides
)}
```

### Express Server Integration

- **Development**: Single port (8080) for both frontend/backend
- **Hot reload**: Both client and server code
- **API endpoints**: Prefixed with `/api/`

#### Example API Routes
- `GET /api/ping` - Simple ping api
- `GET /api/demo` - Demo endpoint  

### Shared Types
Import consistent types in both client and server:
```typescript
import { DemoResponse } from '@shared/api';
```

Path aliases:
- `@shared/*` - Shared folder
- `@/*` - Client folder

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Start dev server (client + server)
npm run dev:updates # Run Astro dev server for the updates blog (localhost:4321)
npm run build      # Production build
npm run start      # Start production server
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript validation
npm test          # Run Vitest tests
```

## Updates Blog (Astro + Decap CMS)

- The weekly update site lives in `updates/` and is powered by **Astro** with Markdown (content collections) for posts.
- Run `npm run dev:updates` for a live preview at `http://localhost:4321/updates`; stop with `Ctrl+C` when finished.
- `npm run build` now also compiles the Astro site and syncs the static output into `dist/updates` so Express can serve it at `/updates`.
- Admin UI: visit `/updates/admin/` to open **Decap CMS**. It stores Markdown in `updates/src/content/updates/` and uploads media to `updates/public/uploads/`.
- To enable GitHub authentication:
  1. Create a Decap-compatible GitHub OAuth app and copy the **App ID**.
  2. Deploy an auth proxy (Netlify Identity, Decap Auth Gateway, or similar) and update `base_url`, `auth_endpoint`, and `app_id` in `updates/public/admin/config.yml`.
  3. Restrict the OAuth app to the correct organization/team; only approved GitHub accounts will be able to publish.
- Editorial workflow is ON. Decap will open pull requests for review before merging to `main`; merge triggers the Astro build during CI.
- Media support: use the media library for images, GIFs, and MP4 clips. Reference assets in Markdown via `/updates/uploads/<filename>`.

## Adding Features

### Add new colors to the theme

Open `client/global.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` and add new tailwind colors.

### New API Route
1. **Optional**: Create a shared interface in `shared/api.ts`:
```typescript
export interface MyRouteResponse {
  message: string;
  // Add other response properties here
}
```

2. Create a new route handler in `server/routes/my-route.ts`:
```typescript
import { RequestHandler } from "express";
import { MyRouteResponse } from "@shared/api"; // Optional: for type safety

export const handleMyRoute: RequestHandler = (req, res) => {
  const response: MyRouteResponse = {
    message: 'Hello from my endpoint!'
  };
  res.json(response);
};
```

3. Register the route in `server/index.ts`:
```typescript
import { handleMyRoute } from "./routes/my-route";

// Add to the createServer function:
app.get("/api/my-endpoint", handleMyRoute);
```

4. Use in React components with type safety:
```typescript
import { MyRouteResponse } from '@shared/api'; // Optional: for type safety

const response = await fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
const data: MyRouteResponse = await response.json();
```

### New Page Route
1. Create component in `client/pages/MyPage.tsx`
2. Add route in `client/App.tsx`:
```typescript
<Route path="/my-page" element={<MyPage />} />
```

## Production Deployment

## Architecture Notes

- Single-port development with Vite + Express integration
- TypeScript throughout (client, server, shared)
- Full hot reload for rapid development
- Production-ready with multiple deployment options
- Comprehensive UI component library included
